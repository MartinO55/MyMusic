# Challenge: Dark Mode It

## MVP

Create a new component called DarkModeIt.
It should have a top container with a button and an image with card below it.
The card should have a title, a paragraph element and a button.

The Container button will generate a random number between 0 and 24.
That number will represent the time (24h) which should be displayed below it.

The Card button will allow you to manually change from Light to Dark Mode.

If the number generated is between 0 and 6 or 18 and 24 (18:00 to 06:00) the image should display a moon.
If the number generated is between 6 and 18 (06:00 to 18:00) the image displayed should be a sun.

In the card, clicking on the button should change the styling of that element from light to dark mode and vice versa.
The text of the button should also change depending on the current mode.
